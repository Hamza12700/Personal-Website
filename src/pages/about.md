## Programming languages

**Golang**: I have extensive experience in Go, leveraging its concurrency model and performance benefits to create highly efficient backend services and command-line tools.

**Typescript/Javascript**: With a solid foundation in both TypeScript and JavaScript, I build dynamic and scalable web applications, ensuring type safety and modern development practices.

**PHP**: My knowledge of PHP enables me to develop robust server-side logic for web applications, integrating seamlessly with various databases and APIs.

**C/C++**: I delve into low-level programming with C and C++, focusing on performance-critical applications and systems programming. This background has provided me with a deep understanding of computer architecture and memory management.

**Zig**: Recently, I have been exploring Zig and its capabilities to prevent memory leaks often encountered in C. Zig's safety features and straightforward syntax make it a compelling choice for systems programming, ensuring robustness and reliability.

## Frontend Frameworks

**React**: I use React to create interactive and efficient user interfaces, focusing on component-based architecture and state management.

**VueJS**: My experience with Vue has been really good, the templating syntax is easy to grasp on and a powerful meta framework [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) to build fullstack web applications.

**Astro**: With Astro, I build fast, optimized websites that combine the best features of static site generation with dynamic capabilities. Even this website is built with Astro.

**Svelte**: I enjoy working with Svelte to create highly performant applications with minimal boilerplate code and a streamlined development process.

**HTMX**: I leverage htmx to add dynamic interactions to web pages without relying heavily on JavaScript, making it easier to build modern, user-friendly interfaces faster. I use Golang as my backend language when I'm working with htmx.

I'm constantly improving my skills and gaining practical experience.
